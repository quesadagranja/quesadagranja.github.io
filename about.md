## About Us

&nbsp;

We are TheReviewIndex.

We thought reading reviews, on sites like Amazon, is a bit too tedious. Most products have hundreds, even thousands of reviews. It's impossible to make sense of that many reviews, let alone compare across products.

So we built [The Review Index](https://thereviewindex.com) that uses Neural Networks to detect and quantify recurring patterns in reviews, enabling one to go through thousands of reviews in a few minutes.

Also - we call out products with significant volumes of spam / fake reviews so that one doesn't end up trusting them. 

We recently launched a public beta for Amazon (US) electronic / gadget / appliance reviews, and are iterating over the website and algorithms. We will expand to include other marketplaces soon.

There is a lot of data waiting to be churned and presented - stay tuned!
