    <p>One of the things I liked the least about R when I was learning to program in it was the <strong>scope of variables</strong>. Its behavior is substantially different from that of other more popular languages and can cause code errors very easily if one doesn’t know how it works.</p>

<p>Let’s see a simple example.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>y &lt;- 3
f &lt;- function(x) {
  x + y
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> variable hasn’t been defined within the environment of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> function, this program <strong>runs correctly</strong>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; f(2)
[1] 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because R uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28computer_science%29">lexical scope</a> to find the value associated with a variable. That is, if R doesn’t find the value of the variable within the function, it will look for it outside, in the environment where the function was defined. This behavior is counter-intuitive for regular C, Python or Matlab programmers, and can be a major source of bugs.</p>

<p>When I discovered this feature, I was developing several functions with many input parameters to be called from a different function. By doing this, my first impression was that I was wasting my time. Because, what’s the point in defining input parameters in R functions? There’s no real need to have functions with input parameters! All you have to do is assign the function’s internal variables <em>before</em> calling the function, and R will do the rest.</p>

<p>Of course, this is <strong><em>not at all elegant</em></strong> and generates a hard-to-read code. While this might work for small files being very careful, it would be unmanageable for large projects.</p>

<p>The best way to bypass the problems generated by the scope of variables in R is to <strong><em>create a package</em></strong>, splitting the functions into different files. In addition, when compiling the package, functions that are not properly defined can be detected with commands like <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/devtools/versions/2.3.2/topics/check"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">devtools::check()</code></a>.</p>
