Welcome to my website, where I, **Carlos Quesada Granja**, ride the waves of cutting-edge scientific research and development as a passionate Data Scientist.

Just as a surfer anticipates and navigates the rise and fall of the ocean's waves, I use my background in Telecommunications Engineering, Information Technology, and Applied Mechanics to harness the power of Machine Learning to solve real-world problems. The sea has always been a source of inspiration for me, with its vast and ever-changing nature reflecting the limitless potential of data and Artificial Intelligence.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the information here as refreshing and energizing as a dip in the ocean. 🌊

### Extended bio

I am a Data Scientist with a background in **Telecommunications Engineering**. I received my **BSc** and **MSc** from Miguel Hernández University of Elche in 2008, and my **DEA** (Diploma of Advanced Studies) in **Information Technology** from the University of Alicante in 2010.

I have a passion for scientific research and development and have dedicated my career to exploring and advancing the field of **Data Science**. My interests and expertise lie in **Artificial Intelligence**, and I have a strong focus on the development, implementation, and deployment of **Machine Learning** models.

I began my research career at the Institute of Neurosciences of Alicante in 2010, where I used data analysis and visualization techniques to study the brain hippocampus. In 2012, I was awarded an **FPI pre-doctoral fellowship** that brought me to the Applied Mechanics and Bioengineering (AMB) group at the University of Zaragoza.

During this time, I completed an **MSc in Applied Mechanics** in 2014, did a research stay at École Centrale de Nantes in France in 2015, and earned my **PhD** in 2017. My thesis was on developing and implementing real-time, haptic-controlled, physics-based surgical simulators using Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) techniques.

After my defense, I did a postdoc at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC) in France in 2017, where I used Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and diffuse approximation techniques for real-time prediction of microcapsule deformation and identification of their mechanical properties. I then returned to the University of Zaragoza in 2019 for a second postdoc, where I applied registration techniques on 3D medical images.

In 2020, I started working as a research associate at DeustoTech, University of Deusto, where I am using unsupervised techniques to model residential energy consumption. In addition to my research duties, I also serve as a lecturer for the *Technical and Scientific Programming* course for students in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence degree program.
