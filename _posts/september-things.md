The work I carried out during my stay at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne focused on the dimensionality reduction of a model of microcapsule deformation, and three years later it continues to bear fruit. The journal XXX has recently published the paper entitled "XXX", of which I am one of the authors. This is therefore the third paper on microcapsules I got published.
