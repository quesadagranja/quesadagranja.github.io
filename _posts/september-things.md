The work I carried out during my stay at the *Université de Technologie de Compiègne* focused on the dimensionality reduction of a model of microcapsule deformation continues to bear fruit three years later. Last September (2021), the journal *A Data-Driven Space-Time-Parameter Reduced-Order Model with Manifold Learning for Coupled Problems: Application to Deformable Capsules Flowing in Microchannels* has recently published the paper entitled *Entropy*, of which I am one of the authors. This is therefore the third paper on microcapsules I got published!
