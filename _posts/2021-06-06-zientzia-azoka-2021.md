The **Zientzia Azoka 2021** science fair took place yesterday morning in Bilbao. It is a yearly space that fosters scientific communication and dissemination among high school students and is open to all audiences. Students between 12 and 18 years old but also professional researchers from Basque universities have exhibited their scientific projects in this fair organized by the Elhuyar Foundation.

This year the **[WHY project](https://www.why-h2020.eu/)**, which I am involved in, has been selected to represent the research conducted by the **University of Deusto** at the fair. It has been a very exciting experience in which we have explained to the curious audience that visited our stand the intense work we have been carrying out since the WHY project started in September last year.

WHY is a 3-year project funded by the European Union that aims to model residential energy consumption based on behavior. We have already [processed, analyzed and clustered](https://www.quesadagranja.com/segmentation-load-profiles) the load profiles (electricity consumption versus time) of tens of thousands of households and now we are collecting extra information to complete our data. At this fair, we presented a Telegram bot that we have just developed to get this extra information. Using a set of QR codes placed near certain household appliances, our bot deploys real-time surveys to the interested users that we will use to learn about energy consumption habits. In exchange for this information, the users receive reports and advice on how to reduce their daily energy consumption.

The fair was a success in terms of attendance. During the four hours that the event lasted, we attended about fifty people who showed their interest in our project.
