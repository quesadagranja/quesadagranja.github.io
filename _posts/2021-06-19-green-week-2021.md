Last week, the WHY project held its first **[WHY Open Day](https://www.why-h2020.eu/news-events/eu-green-week-2021)** in the framework of the **[European Union Green Week 2021](https://www.eugreenweek.eu/)**. The event was titled '_Predicting the Impact of Household Behavior Intervention on Environmental Pollution_', and various stakeholders and policy makers were invited to discuss **Energy System Models** (ESMs). This tools are used to evaluate long-term energy scenarios but, in this context, they can contribute to selecting the best strategies for fighting pollution caused by the energy sector.

The programme of the event was structured in three main blocks:

* an **Opening Session**, with the welcome of institutional authorities and keynote speeches;
* a **first Panel Discussion** on what ESMs can do to help reduce pollution and its materialization in the five use cases of the project;
* and a **second Panel Discussion** on the WHY Toolkit, which will integrate the causal model resulting from the WHY project with the most common ESMs at the European level.

Being part of the project, I had the opportunity to present the work we have developed during the last year at the second Panel Discussion. My presentation focused on the different behavior patterns of electricity consumption that can be identified at household level and the methods we have used to classify them.
