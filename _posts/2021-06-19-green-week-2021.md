Last June 11, the WHY project held its first **[WHY Open Day](https://www.why-h2020.eu/news-events/eu-green-week-2021)** in the framework of the **[European Union Green Week 2021](https://www.eugreenweek.eu/)**. At this event, various stakeholders and policy makers were invited to discuss _Energy System Models_ (ESMs), which contribute to the assessment and selection of strategies for fighting pollution caused by the energy sector.

The programme of the event was structured in three main blocks: an **Opening Session**, a **first Panel Discussion** on what ESMs can do to help reduce pollution, and a **second Panel Discussion** on the WHY Toolkit (one of the most expected results of the project). Being part of the project, I had the opportunity to introduce my work in the second Panel Discussion. Here is my presentation:
