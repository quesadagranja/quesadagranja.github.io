Feeling lucky? Don't be fooled! "*The Devil's Dictionary*", written by Ambrose Bierce in 1911, calls the lottery a "*tax on people who are bad at math.*" With such low odds of winning the big prize, only those who have crunched the numbers will realize that hitting the jackpot is practically impossible. So, if you're playing the lottery, you're essentially paying a "voluntary" tax with no chance of a return on your investment.

Think you have a shot at winning *EuroMillions*? Think again! The odds of matching the winning numbers (5 out of 50 and 2 out of 12) are a staggering 1 in 139,838,160. That's right, you're more likely to get struck by lightning (odds of 1 in 1,222,000 per year according to an Irish insurance company) than hit the *EuroMillions* jackpot. And as if those odds weren't bad enough, they're even worse if you don't live in a particularly rainy region - the chances of getting struck by lightning are still 114 times higher than winning the lottery! So, before you put all your hope (and money) into the *EuroMillions*, consider the math.

However, last month, the Spanish *Bonoloto* saw an extraordinary event—ten winners in a single draw! How did this happen, you ask? The odds of winning the *Bonoloto* (matching 6 out of 49 numbers) are already slim at 1 in 13,983,816. Something unlikely occurred—the winning numbers formed an arithmetic progression with a difference of 11.

This raises the question: was it just a strange coincidence or is there something more at play here? The betting slip may hold a clue—the combination just so happened to form a **diagonal line** on the ticket.

So, out of the 5.1 million people who participated in the Bonoloto draw, ten of them decided to get creative and draw a diagonal line on their betting slips. And wouldn't you know it, they ended up splitting the jackpot of €670,000, receiving only €67,000 each. It just goes to show that trying to be unique can sometimes make you unoriginal. Who knows how many other people participate in the lottery with their own creative twists—lines of all kinds, little clusters, smiley faces, geometric shapes... the possibilities are endless!

The moral of the story: if you want to stand out, be as random as possible!
