**Benford's law** states that in many collections of numbers that occur naturally, those numbers whose leading digit is 1 will appear more frequently than numbers beginning with other digits. Some of these collections of numbers include

1. the number of followers of Twitter users,
2. the number of books in US libraries,
3. the population of Spanish cities,
4. the street numbers of Brazilian addresses, and so on.

The website [testingbenfordslaw.com](testingbenfordslaw.com) provides a visual check of these examples and many more.

This law, which might seem irrelevant, has interesting applications in forensic accounting, auditing and **fraud detection**, as described in the book by Mark J. Nigrini, [*Benford's law*](https://books.google.es/books/about/Benford_s_Law.html?id=Bh5Vr_I1NZoC). For example, a claim that circulated on social media after the 2020 US Presidential election was that some of the votes for Joe Biden seemed suspicious because they did not follow Benford's law.
