The work that I carried out during my stay at the *Université de Technologie de Compiègne*, focused on the dimensionality reduction of a model of microcapsule deformation, continues to bear fruit three years later. The journal *Entropy* has published the paper entitled [*A Data-Driven Space-Time-Parameter Reduced-Order Model with Manifold Learning for Coupled Problems: Application to Deformable Capsules Flowing in Microchannels*](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/9/1193/htm), of which I am one of the authors. This is therefore the **third paper on microcapsules** I got published! The paper proposes a dimensionality reduction technique to model **suspensions of microcapsules**, that is, microdrops protected in a thin hyperelastic membrane, which are used in healthcare as drug vehicles.
