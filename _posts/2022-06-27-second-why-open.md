This morning the **_WHY Second Open Day_** (_EUSEW'22 Energy Day_) took place in the framework of the _EU European Sustainable Energy Days 2022_.

I participated in this webinar with the 45-minute presentation entitled "_How many types of energy consumers are in Europe?_", which also gave the name to the session itself. I also participated in the final panel, entitled "_How these results could be reused in science and policy-making_", together with my colleagues from DeustoTech, Cruz Borges and Diego Casado.

The videos of the session, as well as the slides of the presentations, will be available soon. My presentation focused on the results we have obtained in the WHY project. In particular, I talked about the **segmentation of households** that we have carried out according to their energy consumption, which has resulted in forty well differentiated consumption patterns that we have familiary called "_the top 40_". This presentation discussed the **clustering methodology** we have followed and the taxonomy we have developed to classify electricity consumers. In addition, I have described the analyses we have carried out at both **regional** and **temporal** levels.

This second _WHY Open Day_ was held one year after the first one, which was part of the [_European Union Green Week 2021_](https://www.quesadagranja.com/green-week-2021).
