**Magic: The Gathering** (**MTG**) is a super funny card game inspired by fantasy role-playing games. MTG emulates a combat between players' creatures, where not only their strength matters but also their abilities. Magic is also relevant and it's present in the form of enchantments, artifacts, sorceries and many other exciting spells. There is a huge variety of creatures (and other spells) with which to compose your deck, roughly organized in five colors:

* **white** for angels, clerics and spells that evoke life;
* **black** for demons, vampires and deadly spells;
* **red** for goblins, dragons, fire and explosions;
* **green** for elves and other forest creatures;
* and **blue** for aquatic monsters and psychic spells.

**Uncolored** and **multi-colored** cards also exist. And cats, [many kinds of cats](https://hobbylark.com/card-games/best-cat-cards-mtg). The catalog is really huge, continually expanding and can be consulted on [*Gatherer*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx), the MTG card database.

MTG, however, has a steep learning curve that makes it hard to understand at first. The complexity of its rules may be discouraging  (each card has its own instructions!) and, to top it off, it's often considered a *game for nerds*. If, despite that, you want to learn how to play, I recommend the computer version, [*MTG Arena*](https://magic.wizards.com/es/mtgarena), which is freemium, fully playable and has an excellent tutorial.
